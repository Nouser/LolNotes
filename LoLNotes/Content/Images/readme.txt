Champion icons are from '\League of Legends\RADS\projects\lol_air_client\releases\0.0.0.223\deploy\assets\images\champions'.
Specifically the images with 'Square_0' in the name (use windows search with 'square' to filter down to just those images).

I use fotosizer to batch resize all of them to 30x30.
Resizing isn't necessary, I just do it to save space.
